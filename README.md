# SampleCollectionView

A sample iOS project containing one screen with a dead simple `UICollectionView`. Can be used as a framework for experimenting with collection views.

The collection view is created programmatically and contains one type of cells that are layed out in a vertical fashion resembling default `UITableView`. The collection view is layed out with `UICollectionViewFlowLayout`.
